# Tutorial: Scholarship-Finder

This project is a **Scholarship Finder** application designed to help users find relevant scholarships.
It uses a central *Scholarship Dataset* and allows users to perform *personalized searches* based on their profile details.
It also provides *categorized listings* for browsing scholarships by specific criteria.
The *Navigation System* allows users to switch between finding methods and other sections, all presented through a simple *User Interface*.
